focuses on IoT challenges in a mining environment.

# Staying up to date (a rough guide, not heavily tested, feedback welcome)

Contributing
In the compressed timeframe of the hackthon, we'll not bother with feature branches, just a branch per person so that changes can be committed for review/help/discussion without affecting master.  But if its a simple change feel free to create and merge PR straight away.
