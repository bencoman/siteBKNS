# Introduction
This is the hackathon project repository of team "siteBKNS" in the Unearthed Digital Tribes hackathon event,
focuses on IoT challenges in a mining environment.

# Staying up to date (a rough guide, not heavily tested, feedback welcome)

Contributing
In the compressed timeframe of the hackthon, we'll not bother with feature branches, just a branch per person so that changes can be committed for review/help/discussion without affecting master.  But if its a simple change feel free to create and merge PR straight away.

Using Github Desktop as reference...
Current branch = <yourname>
1. Fetch origin
2. Branch > Update from default branch
3. Push to origin.
4. Check the network graph looks as expected.
