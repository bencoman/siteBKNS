# Introduction
This is the hackathon project repository of team "siteBKNS" in the Unearthed Digital Tribes hackathon event,
focuses on IoT challenges in a mining environment.

# Contributing
In the compressed timeframe of the hackthon, we'll not bother with feature branches, just a branch per person so that changes can be committed for review/help/discussion without affecting master.  But if its a simple change feel free to create and merge PR straight away.





## Staying up to date (a rough guide, not heavily tested, feedback welcome)

Update to master as often as possible/convenient. Using Github Desktop as reference...
Current branch = <yourname>
1. Check the network graph looks as expected. https://github.com/bencoman/siteBKNS/network
2. Fetch origin
3. Branch > Update from default branch
4. Push to origin.
5. Check the network graph looks as expected. https://github.com/bencoman/siteBKNS/network

## Add work
6. Check you have <yourname> branch checked out.
7. Do work.
8. Commit to local (cloned) repository using a good message.
9. Push to server.
10. Check the network graph https://github.com/bencoman/siteBKNS/network
11 Click on [Code] tab.
12. Select branc: <yourname>
13. Click [New pull request]
14. If you previously wrote a good commit message, just click [Create pull request]
otherwise write a good one now.
15. If its a simple change, immediately click [Merge], 
otherwise on Slack ask for a review. 

Note: PRs are not just for merging code, but also a good mechanism to collaborate by writing notes next to lines of code.  Subsequent commits to your branch drag the PR along with it until its ready to actually merge. 

Remember - Release Early, Release Often! 
And have Fun!
